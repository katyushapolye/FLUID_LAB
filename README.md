FLUID_LAB V0.1

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) application implementing multiple fluid simulation methods for the Imcompressible Navier-Stokes equations with real-time visualization and real time analysis tools I made during holidays for research and testing different methods and finding their strenghts and weaknesses.
This project provides three distinct fluid simulation approaches, each optimized for different physical scenarios:

  <b>ADI (Eulerian) </b> | <b>FLIP (Hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian)</b> | <b>SPH (Lagrangian)</b>
</p
  
Validation Test Cases

ADI(3D/2D) Eulerian (Gasses) Solver:
 - Lid-Driven Cavity Flow [1]
 - Flow Past Obstacle (Wind tunnel with sphere/circle) [2]
 - Backward-Facing Step [3]

   
FLIP(3D/2D) & SPH(2D) (Liquid) Solvers:
 - Dam Break scenario


Currently, the implementation is powered with:
  - OpenMP-accelerated CPU computation with Eigen library for small systems and ADI solutions (With TDMA Algorithm)
  - GPU Acceleration: NVIDIA AMGX library for sparse matrix operations in pressure solving in heavy Poisson Systems.
  - Custom made MAC (Marker-and-Cell) grid layout for optimal memory access patterns with linearized storage and indexing.

Interface:
 - ImGUI-based control panel
 - Real-time plotting with ImPlot (2D graphs)
 - 3D visualization with ImPlot3D
 - ParaView-compatible grid format export (.vtk)
